            Liability
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent
            permitted by law, PicAI makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and
            negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of
            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property,
            or other violation of rights.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            In no event shall PicAI or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred
            by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
            on this website, even if PicAI or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in
            writing, of the possibility of such damage.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            In the context of this agreement, "consequential loss" includes any consequential loss, indirect
            loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss
            of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or
            corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence),
            indemnity or otherwise.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of
            liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
